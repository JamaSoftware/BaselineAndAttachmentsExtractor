###Retrieve Baselines and Attachments
This script was designed to retrieve all baselines of a given Jama Set. For each retrieved baseline, the script will retrieve all baseline children and their attachments will be downloaded. If no baselines exist, the current version of the Set will be retrieved.  

Please note that this script is distrubuted as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.  This example omits error checking. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the script.

### Before you begin
